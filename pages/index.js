          <p>I am a full stack engineer specializing in front-end 
          development with a particular interest in ventures 
          with an orientation towards social equity and the arts.</p>

          <p>I am passionate about breaking problems down into their 
          smallest parts in order to build successful interventions. 
          My background in nonprofit marketing has taught me the 
          value of metrics-driven work, creative workarounds, and 
          constructing projects from the userâ€™s perspective.</p>

          <p>In my spare time, I enjoy caring for my brood of houseplants, 
          an inordinate amount of crossword puzzles, and inundating friends
          and family with my excess baked goods.</p>
