          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a full stack engineer specializing in front-end 
          development with a particular interest in ventures 
          with an orientation towards social equity and the arts.</p>   
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I love breaking problems down into their 
          smallest parts in order to build successful interventions. 
          My background in nonprofit marketing has taught me the 
          value of metrics-driven work, creative workarounds, and 
          constructing projects from the user’s perspective.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>In my spare time, I enjoy caring for my brood of houseplants, 
          an inordinate amount of crossword puzzles, and inundating friends
          and family with my excess baked goods.</p>

        <p>Wake: Yer fond of me lobster aint’ ye? I seen it -- yer fond of me lobster! Say it! Say it. Say it!

Winslow: I don’t have to say nothin’.

Wake: Damn ye! Let Neptune strike ye dead Winslow! HAAARK!

Hark Triton, hark! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full foul in his fury! Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother this young mouth with pungent slime, to choke ye, engorging your organs til’ ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no more -- only when he, crowned in cockle shells with slitherin’ tentacle tail and steaming beard take up his fell be-finned arm, his coral-tine trident screeches banshee-like in the tempest and plunges right through yer gullet, bursting ye -- a bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film now and nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of the Dread Emperor himself -- forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil, forgotten even to the sea, for any stuff for part of Winslow, even any scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea!

Winslow: Alright, have it your way. I like your cookin’.</p>
